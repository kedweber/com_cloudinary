# com_cloudinary

[Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com) is a cloud based image management service that acts as a CDN as well as an image manipulation
tool. `com_cloudinary` is a Joomla! package that handles image uploads, manipulation and even multiple accounts.

The system requirements are

* Nooku Server 12.X .
* PHP 5.3.6 or better

or

* Joomla 2.5 or 3.X
* Koowa 0.9 or 1.0 (as yet, Koowa 2 is not supported)
* PHP 5.3.10 or better

`com_cloudinary` was developed by [Moyo Web Architects](http://www.moyoweb.nl/).

## Installation

### Composer

Installation is done through composer. In your `composer.json` file, you should add the following lines to the repositories
section:

    "name": "moyo/com_cloudinary",
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/moyoweb/com_cloudinary.git"
}
```

or from the company that funded this development;

```json
{
    "name": "moyo/com_cloudinary",
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/moyoweb/com_cloudinary.git"
}
```

The require section should contain the following line:

```json

```

Afterward, just run `composer update` from the root of your Joomla project.
